With Express API, this command-line application connects to mySQL database using Sequelize.

After schema & seeds commands, database environment created with test data.

Init prompt launches server, models sync to database.

When opening API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products,
or tags, the data for each route is displayed in formatted JSON.

When testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, I am able
to successfully create, update, and delete data in the database.
